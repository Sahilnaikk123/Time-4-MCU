            <p class="film-summary">If you want to watch all the Marvel movies in chronological order, then you have to
                start with Captain America: The First Avenger. Not the best Marvel movie by a long shot, but given it
                takes place during World War 2, in 1942 to be exact, its setting is certainly the oldest.<br>
                Travel back in time to watch Cap fight HYDRA masquerading as Nazis and fall for Peggy Carter, only to be
                frozen in ice so he could conveniently leapfrog through time to the present day and eventually team up
                with the Avengers. This is where it all began...

            <p class="flim-detail">Release date: July 25, 2025<br>
                Cast:Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach<br></p>

            <p class="film-summary">In 2025, the First Family finally made its triumphant entrance into the MCU... sort
                of. Though the plan is to have them link up with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in the continuity dubbed 616
                in Avengers: Doomsday, their first MCU outing takes place in 1964, but in a different timeline — one
                inspired by a retrofuturistic aesthetic — which sets it apart from past movies based on the characters.
                (That and good reviews.)<br>

                Skipping the group’s cosmic rays incident and following them after becoming famous as their Earth’s
                protectors, the story instead focuses on the arrival of the Silver Surfer and Galactus as they seek to
                consume Earth unless Franklin Richards is surrendered.<br>
                With the 1964 setting, we're placing it here to be technically correct (the best kind of correct), but
                given First Step's alternative universe setting, we think it should be watched after Thunderbolts*.

                Set in 1995, Marvel gave us a strong blast of nostalgia with this origin movie, which saw appearances
                from 90s icons such as Blockbuster, payphones, and Nine Inch Nails. Plus, it was the first Marvel movie
                to have one of its main characters de-aged using some impressive CGI so a young Nick Fury could kick ass
                right alongside one of the most powerful superheroes in the franchise.

            <p class="film-summary">That brings us to Iron Man, the very first Marvel movie made, but the third in
                chronological order. Set in 2010, this origin movie started it all for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as
                Tony Stark creates the Iron Man suit to escape his captors and then become a powerful but arrogant
                superhero.

                With his P.A. Pepper Potts and friend Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes along for the ride, Tony eventually
                takes down baddie Obadiah Stane who arranged Tony's kidnapping so he could take over Stark Industries.

            <p class="film-summary">Less than a year later Tony is back in hot water as the son of a former Stark
                Industries employee, Ivan Vanko, tries to kill him using his own version of Tony's Iron Man suit
                technology. And, as if that wasn't bad enough, Tony finds out that the palladium core in the Arc Reactor
                that keeps him alive and powers his suit is actually killing him.

                All in all, Tony isn't having a great year, but thanks to a little help from Nick Fury and Natasha
                Romanoff, aka S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Black Widow, he eventually cures himself and takes down Vanko.

                Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth<br></p>

            <p class="film-summary">At the same time, Bruce Banner is trying to find a cure for his condition which sees
                him turn into a big, raging, green monster anytime he feels a bit irritated. Set in 2011, Banner is
                being hunted by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross who sends special forces soldier Emil Blonsky to
                take him down. Unfortunately, Blonsky is no match for the Hulk which is why he agrees to be injected
                with a similar serum to the one that turned Banner into the Hulk. The problem is, it also makes him
                insane. Eventually becoming Abomination and going on a killing rampage, Banner convinces Ross to let him
                stop Blonsky and save the day.

                Whether this movie counts as part of the MCU is up for debate - Disney/Marvel say no, but it was very
                clearly meant to be in the MCU when it was created, as evidenced by Tony Stark's post-credits cameo.

                Meanwhile, on Asgard, Thor's brother Loki, the God of Mischief, finds out he's actually adopted and

                They're also joined by Black Widow and her pal Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye. Long story short, a huge
                battle ensues destroying most of New York, but eventually ends with Loki being captured and taken back
                to Asgard for a spanking.

                start going off all over the place, allegedly orchestrated by the Mandarin.

                During his investigation into the Mandarin, Tony discovers that scientist Aldrich Killian is really
                behind the attacks and that he's kidnapped the President. Tony teams up with Rhodey to save the
                President, eventually destroying all his suits and promising Pepper he'll tone down the superhero thing
                for a while.

            <p class="film-summary">In 2017, Thor returns to Asgard to discover his brother Loki is alive and
                impersonating their father, Odin. They find their dad, only to discover he's dying and that they
                apparently have a terrible older sister, Hela, who's only kept caged by Odin's magic. Once he dies Hela
                appears and takes over Asgard, promising to wage war on the rest of the universe.

                Thor and Loki escape to Sakaar and are reunited with the Hulk (who's been missing since Age of Ultron)
                and make friends with Valkyrie. They band together to return to Asgard and defeat Hela by bringing about
                Ragnarok/the apocalypse, escaping with most of Asgard's people on a spaceship.

            <p class="film-summary">At the same time, Scott/Ant-Man is under house arrest thanks to his involvement in
                Captain America: Civil War when he runs into Hope and Hank who are on the run because the authorities
                think they also had something to do with it. They need his help to rescue Hope's mom Janet from the
                Quantum Realm, but they're not the only ones trying to master the Quantum Realm. Ghost tries to steal
                Hank's lab, but Ant-Man and the Wasp team up to stop her while Hank successfully brings Janet back from
                the Quantum Realm. Everything works out fine, until everyone mysteriously disintegrates, except for
                Ant-Man, who's trapped in the Quantum Realm.

                There's a lot of quantum physics stuff going on here, and if you want to know more about it we've done a
                dive into just how realistic Ant-Man's quantum science is.

            <p class="film-director">by <strong>Anthony Russo</strong></p>

            <p class="flim-detail">Release date: April 27, 2018<br>

            <p class="film-summary">Thanos, who's already in possession of the Power Stone, destroys the Asgardian ship,
                killing Loki (for real this time), to get the Space Stone. He then sends his adopted children to Earth
                in search of the Mind and Time Stones, as he goes off to find the Reality and Soul Stones.

                The Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and almost every other superhero in the MCU try their hardest
                to stop Thanos from getting the Infinity Stones, but one by one he claims them all and the movie
                climaxes with him snapping his figures to whipping out half of the universe. Bummer.

            <p class="film-summary">Five years later and the world is still trying to readjust to life after losing so
                much when Ant-Man returns from the Quantum Realm with an idea to bring everyone back. Using his
                knowledge, Tony and smart Hulk find a way to time travel and they, along with the remaining heroes, go
                back to different points in time to find the Infinity Stones before Thanos.

                When they return (minus Black Widow who's killed, R.I.P), they use the stones to bring everyone back –
                but Thanos is back too and ALL the Avengers must assemble to stop him. Iron Man saves the day with a
                click of his fingers but dies in the attempt.
