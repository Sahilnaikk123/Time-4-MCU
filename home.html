                <p class="film-summary">If you want to watch all the Marvel movies in chronological order, then you have to start with Captain America: The First Avenger. Not the best Marvel movie by a long shot, but given it takes place during World War 2, in 1942 to be exact, its setting is certainly the oldest.<br>
                    Travel back in time to watch Cap fight HYDRA masquerading as Nazis and fall for Peggy Carter, only to be frozen in ice so he could conveniently leapfrog through time to the present day and eventually team up with the Avengers. This is where it all began...

                <p class="film-director">by <strong>Jon Favreau</strong></p>

                <p class="flim-detail">Release date: July 25, 2025<br>
                             Cast:Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach<br></p>

                <p class="film-summary">In 2025, the First Family finally made its triumphant entrance into the MCU... sort of. Though the plan is to have them link up with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in the continuity dubbed 616 in Avengers: Doomsday, their first MCU outing takes place in 1964, but in a different timeline — one inspired by a retrofuturistic aesthetic — which sets it apart from past movies based on the characters. (That and good reviews.)<br>

                Skipping the group’s cosmic rays incident and following them after becoming famous as their Earth’s protectors, the story instead focuses on the arrival of the Silver Surfer and Galactus as they seek to consume Earth unless Franklin Richards is surrendered.<br>
                    With the 1964 setting, we're placing it here to be technically correct (the best kind of correct), but given First Step's alternative universe setting, we think it should be watched after Thunderbolts*.
