                <p class="flim-detail">Release date: July 22, 2011<br>

                <p class="film-summary">If you want to watch all the Marvel movies in chronological order, then you have to start with Captain America: The First Avenger. Not the best Marvel movie by a long shot, but given it takes place during World War 2, in 1942 to be exact, its setting is certainly the oldest.<br>
                    Travel back in time to watch Cap fight HYDRA masquerading as Nazis and fall for Peggy Carter, only to be frozen in ice so he could conveniently leapfrog through time to the present day and eventually team up with the Avengers. This is where it all began...

                <p class="film-director">by <strong> Matt Shakman</strong></p>

                <p class="flim-detail">Release date: July 25, 2025<br>
                             Cast:Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach<br></p>

                <p class="film-summary">In 2025, the First Family finally made its triumphant entrance into the MCU... sort of. Though the plan is to have them link up with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in the continuity dubbed 616 in Avengers: Doomsday, their first MCU outing takes place in 1964, but in a different timeline — one inspired by a retrofuturistic aesthetic — which sets it apart from past movies based on the characters. (That and good reviews.)<br>

                Skipping the group’s cosmic rays incident and following them after becoming famous as their Earth’s protectors, the story instead focuses on the arrival of the Silver Surfer and Galactus as they seek to consume Earth unless Franklin Richards is surrendered.<br>
                    With the 1964 setting, we're placing it here to be technically correct (the best kind of correct), but given First Step's alternative universe setting, we think it should be watched after Thunderbolts*.

                <p class="film-summary">Next, you'll jump forward in time to the 90s where Captain Marvel discovers grunge as well as a community of Skrulls hiding in plain sight on Earth.

                    Set in 1995, Marvel gave us a strong blast of nostalgia with this origin movie, which saw appearances from 90s icons such as Blockbuster, payphones, and Nine Inch Nails. Plus, it was the first Marvel movie to have one of its main characters de-aged using some impressive CGI so a young Nick Fury could kick ass right alongside one of the most powerful superheroes in the franchise.

                <p class="film-summary">That brings us to Iron Man, the very first Marvel movie made, but the third in chronological order. Set in 2010, this origin movie started it all for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tony Stark creates the Iron Man suit to escape his captors and then become a powerful but arrogant superhero.

                With his P.A. Pepper Potts and friend Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes along for the ride, Tony eventually takes down baddie Obadiah Stane who arranged Tony's kidnapping so he could take over Stark Industries.

                <p class="film-summary">Less than a year later Tony is back in hot water as the son of a former Stark Industries employee, Ivan Vanko, tries to kill him using his own version of Tony's Iron Man suit technology. And, as if that wasn't bad enough, Tony finds out that the palladium core in the Arc Reactor that keeps him alive and powers his suit is actually killing him.

                    All in all, Tony isn't having a great year, but thanks to a little help from Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff, aka S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Black Widow, he eventually cures himself and takes down Vanko.

                            Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth<br></p>

                <p class="film-summary">At the same time, Bruce Banner is trying to find a cure for his condition which sees him turn into a big, raging, green monster anytime he feels a bit irritated. Set in 2011, Banner is being hunted by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross who sends special forces soldier Emil Blonsky to take him down. Unfortunately, Blonsky is no match for the Hulk which is why he agrees to be injected with a similar serum to the one that turned Banner into the Hulk. The problem is, it also makes him insane. Eventually becoming Abomination and going on a killing rampage, Banner convinces Ross to let him stop Blonsky and save the day.

                Whether this movie counts as part of the MCU is up for debate - Disney/Marvel say no, but it was very clearly meant to be in the MCU when it was created, as evidenced by Tony Stark's post-credits cameo.

There he meets scientist Jane Foster and learns how to live as a mortal for a while.

                Meanwhile, on Asgard, Thor's brother Loki, the God of Mischief, finds out he's actually adopted and doesn't take it particularly well. Eventually, Thor proves himself worthy enough to once again wield his hammer and returns to Asgard to stop Loki from causing any more trouble, only to witness his brother supposedly die.

A recently unfrozen Cap, Iron Man (who's trying to be slightly more of a team player), a reluctant Banner/Hulk, and Thor (who's traveled to Earth to stop his brother) all team up to stop Loki.

                They're also joined by Black Widow and her pal Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye. Long story short, a huge battle ensues destroying most of New York, but eventually ends with Loki being captured and taken back to Asgard for a spanking.

Loki is, once again, supposedly killed during the confrontation and Malekith tries to use the Aether to wreak havoc on Earth, but is stopped by Thor and Jane.
